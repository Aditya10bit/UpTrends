# üîí Security Guide for UpTrends

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the UpTrends app and provides guidelines for maintaining security.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features Implemented

### 1. Environment Variable Protection
- All API keys and sensitive credentials are stored in environment variables
- `.env` file is properly gitignored to prevent credential exposure
- Firebase configuration uses environment variables exclusively
- Validation ensures no hardcoded credentials in source code

### 2. API Key Security
- Gemini API keys are accessed through secure wrapper functions
- Rate limiting implemented to prevent API abuse
- Error handling prevents key exposure in logs
- Fallback responses when API calls fail

### 3. Firebase Security
- Authentication with AsyncStorage persistence
- Firestore security rules (should be configured in Firebase console)
- No hardcoded Firebase credentials in source code
- Environment variable validation on app startup

### 4. Code Security
- TypeScript for type safety
- Input validation for user data
- Secure image handling with proper permissions
- No sensitive data in client-side code

## üîß Security Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with these variables:

```env
# Gemini AI API Key
EXPO_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Firebase Configuration (Client-side accessible with EXPO_PUBLIC_ prefix)
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key_here
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.firebasestorage.app
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
```

### Security Validation

Run the security validation script before deploying:

```bash
node scripts/validate-security.js
```

This script checks for:
- ‚úÖ Environment file security
- ‚úÖ Hardcoded API keys
- ‚úÖ Proper environment variable usage
- ‚úÖ Security configuration completeness
- ‚úÖ .gitignore completeness
- ‚úÖ Firebase configuration security

## üö® Security Checklist

Before deploying or sharing code:

- [ ] Run `node scripts/validate-security.js`
- [ ] Ensure `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Verify no API keys in source code
- [ ] Check Firebase security rules
- [ ] Validate all environment variables are set
- [ ] Test app with production credentials
- [ ] Review any new dependencies for security issues

## üîê Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit credentials**
   - Always use environment variables
   - Double-check before committing
   - Use the security validation script

2. **API Key Management**
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Use different keys for development/production
   - Monitor API usage for anomalies

3. **Code Reviews**
   - Review all changes for security issues
   - Check for hardcoded credentials
   - Validate input handling

### For Deployment

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Set all required environment variables
   - Use secure hosting with HTTPS
   - Enable proper CORS settings

2. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor API usage and costs
   - Set up alerts for unusual activity
   - Regular security audits

## üö® Security Incident Response

If you discover a security issue:

1. **Do not commit the issue to version control**
2. **Immediately rotate any exposed credentials**
3. **Update environment variables**
4. **Run security validation**
5. **Test the fix thoroughly**
6. **Document the incident and resolution**

## üìû Security Contacts

For security-related questions or to report vulnerabilities:
- Review this security guide
- Run the validation script
- Check the implementation in `config/security.ts`

## üîÑ Security Updates

This security guide should be updated when:
- New security features are added
- API keys or services change
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered
- Best practices evolve
